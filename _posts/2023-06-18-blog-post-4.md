## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
1 + 1
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}
```
[1] 2
```
:::
:::


You can add options to executable code like this


::: {.cell}
::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}
```
[1] 4
```
:::
:::


The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
