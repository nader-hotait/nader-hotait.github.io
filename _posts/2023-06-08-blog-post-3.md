This blog presents a study on the TikTok activities of Muslim Interaktiv, a group often linked to Hizb ut-Tahrir, although this is contested. The primary objective of this research is to gain insights into their effective occupation of digital discourses and their ability to amass spectatorship for their content. By examining their strategies, I aim to identify knowledge on one way virality is fostered on TikTok. Additionally, I argue the urgency for practitioners to adopt similar tactics to engage in these very discourses for social good. To achieve this, I have transcribed, coded, and analyzed of all Muslim Interaktiv videos for the year 2021. The findings are presented below.
