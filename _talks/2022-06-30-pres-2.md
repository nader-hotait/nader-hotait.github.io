As the chair of the panel, I had the privilege of hosting presentations by [Mujtaba Isani](https://twitter.com/IsaniMujtaba), [Nicole Doerr](https://twitter.com/nicolemdoerr), and [Liriam Sponholz](https://twitter.com/liriamsponholz), while also delivering my own presentation entitled "Narratives of Xeno- and Islamophobia in 'Islamist' Communication: An Analysis of Hizb ut-Tahrir Adjacent Twitter Accounts in Germany." The panel, titled "Islamism and Xenophobia in Europe: Dynamics of Extremism and Feedback Effects," explored the reciprocal relationship between xenophobia and 'Islamism', highlighting how anti-Muslim sentiments and radicalization can mutually influence each other.

In my presentation, I showcased evidence illustrating how Twitter accounts associated with Hizb ut-Tahrir consistently highlight xenophobia, Islamophobia, and Muslim grievances, emphasizing the necessity for political action in accordance with their own agenda and approach.
