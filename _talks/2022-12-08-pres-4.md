I held this Webtalk, hosted by Ufuq.de, which primarily catered to practitioners and researchers. During my presentation, I provided outlined of how TikTok could potentially facilitate radicalization and emphasized the role that collective emotions might play here. At the end, I presented concrete examples of accounts that use emotive triggers to substantiate my arguments. My slides are right [here](https://nader-hotait.github.io/ufuq_vortrag).
