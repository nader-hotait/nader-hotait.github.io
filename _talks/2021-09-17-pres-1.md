This presentation ("Islamist" strategies of radicalization) was held at the Wissenschaftskonferenz (Science Conference) by the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) in 2021, providing an introduction to the novel D:Islam project and its then first module.

I must admit that I am not proud of this presentation, its content, and phrasing. Today, I would have heavily criticized it. However, in the spirit of transparency, I am providing the slides right [here](/files/zaf_pres.pdf).
