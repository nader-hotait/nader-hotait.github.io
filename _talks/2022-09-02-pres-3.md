MOTRA is a "Monitoring system and transfer platform for radicalization \[research\]." In their annual conference in 2022, I elaborated on the potentials for radicalization through TikTok and provided data I had collected through a "self-experiment" and analysis of the TikTok account "Muslim Interaktiv." The presentation was titled "Potentials of Radicalization on TikTok."

Through my blog posts, you can find the findings of my [self-experiment](/posts/2022/06/blog-post-2/) and [investigation of Muslim Interaktiv](/posts/2022/06/blog-post-3/), next to some commentary. The slides are available [here](https://nader-hotait.github.io/motra_pres/#1).
