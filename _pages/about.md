👋 Welcome! My name is Nader Hotait, and am I research associate at the [Berlin Institut for Integration and Migration Research (BIM)](https://www.bim.hu-berlin.de/de/bim) at the Humboldt University of Berlin 👨‍💻. Also, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Sociology at the University of Mannheim's [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/) 📚. My current research focuses on reconstructing the prevalence of radical material in the algorithmically curated feeds of social media users and exploring its possible effects on radicalization 📚.
