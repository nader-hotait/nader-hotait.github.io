👋 Welcome! My name is Nader Hotait.<br>

👨‍💻 I am research associate at the [Berlin Institut for Integration and Migration Research (BIM)](https://www.bim.hu-berlin.de/de/bim) at the Humboldt University of Berlin.<br>

📚 Also, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Sociology at the University of Mannheim's [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/).<br>

🔬My current research focuses on reconstructing the prevalence of radical material in the (algorithmically curated) feeds of social media users and exploring its possible effects on radicalization.<br>

## 📱 Radicalization Potentials on TikTok
I am leading a research project called RaPoTik (Radicalization Potentials on TikTok), in collaboration with my colleague [Özgür Özvatan](https://twitter.com/OzgurOzvatan). This project is funded by the Berlin State Commission against Violence and aims to assess the thread of radicalization through TikTok consumption. TikTok has been under increasing scrutiny for disseminating extremist content, raising concerns about its impact on radicalization. Therefore, with RaPoTik, our primary objective is to investigate the prevalence of radical content among German Muslim TikTok users and evaluate the potential effects of this exposure on the process of radicalization.

Our research project consists of three key stages (see Figure ). The first stage involves conducting a qualitative inquiry of Muslim content creators on TikTok. This stage allows us to explore their ideological diversity, distinct narratives, and linguistic expressions. Not only do we intend to contribute to the broader study of Muslim communities but also gather the necessary (prior) knowledge for the subsequent stages, as they are quantitative in nature.

In the second stage, we employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze TikTok user data, specifically to identify radical content. Our goal is to quantify the prevalence of radical content among German Muslim TikTok users. By leveraging computational methods, we can gain insights into the nature and pervasiveness of radical content on the platform.

The third stage of RaPoTik involves an experimental setting, where we deliberately expose participants to the identified radical content through the TikTok interface for two weeks. By measuring their responses and reactions afterwards, we aim to understand the potential impact of exposure to such content. This stage allows us to examine the relationship between TikTok consumption, exposure to radical content, and potential radicalization tendencies.
